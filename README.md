## 🧠 Core Expertise

- Node.js performance engineering  
- Runtime analysis and system behavior  
- Energy and carbon-aware software design  
- HTTP caching and infrastructure optimization  
- Lightweight and durable web architectures

## 🔬 Open Source Work

### NodeFootPrint

Creator of **NodeFootPrint** — an open-source engine designed to measure and analyze the energy footprint of Node.js applications.

NodeFootPrint explores:

- CPU workload analysis  
- Energy estimation models  
- System-level metrics  
- Performance–energy correlation  
- Carbon-aware computation models  

The goal: understand how software behavior translates into energy impact.

## ⚙️ Production Engineering

Beyond tooling and research, I apply the same engineering principles to real-world systems, including:

- High-performance WordPress architectures  
- Technical audits (performance, caching, infrastructure)  
- Sustainable optimization for local businesses and public institutions  
- Server and runtime-level performance diagnostics

## 🎯 Engineering Philosophy

Performance is not only about speed.  
It is about efficiency, clarity and long-term technical responsibility.

Software should be measurable.  
Systems should be understandable.  
Optimization should be intentional.
